All fields except special fields (e.g. {{ portals # article/fields/portal }}, {{ artifacts # article/fields/artifact }},...) are called basic fields. They all have a local skill tree to individualize each field. All basic fields are able to produce {{ soulstones # article/currencies/soulstones }} but are limited in unit recruitment. A unit can only be recruited on certain fields (with the exception of {{  Spotter Nakis # article/units/spotter-naki }}). \n Note that different rules apply to the world type Evolution!",

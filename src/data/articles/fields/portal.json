      "paragraph": "Since every player needs to go through the portal to leave or enter an island, there is a special portal-sharing in place concerning teams. \n\n <strong>Short example:</strong> Player A and B belong to the same team. Player A currently owns the portal but player B would like to pass through the portal as well in order to send his units to another island. \n If player B sends support to the portal, he will take complete ownership of the portal as well as all units that were stationed within the portal field at the point of Player Bs arrival. \n\n <strong>Takeaway:</strong> Unless you fully trust your teammates, you should never leave your units on the portal field. Otherwise it might be possible for one of your teammates to “steal” your units by taking over the portal field."

The effect then stays with the artifact and cannot be changed. \n\n The exact strength of the artifact-effect can vary by a maximum of +300%, though it is extremely unlikely to see values higher than about +75%. \n\n Example: Artifact A has a base effect of granting 10% Attack Buff. Thanks to the variation, the base effect gets increased by 50%, resulting in a total of 15% Attack Buff granted to the team of the artifact owner.",
